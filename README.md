# Virtual assistant 
Project developed through a video lesson from [Digital Innovation One](https://www.dio.me/) with the goal of introducing knowledge about IoT and Machine Learning. For this, a virtual assistant was created using the Python programming language, along with the OS and Speech Recognition libraries.

## üî® Project functionality
The main function of this project is to make the virtual assistant perform some simple functions, such as typing what the user said, opening Google Chrome and Excel.

## üíª Technologies and techniques used 
* [Python](https://www.python.org/): programming language
* [Speech Recognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/): voice recognition
* [OS](https://docs.python.org/pt-br/3.7/library/os.html): use features that are operating system-dependent

## üìÅ Access and execute project
### 1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) on your computer

### 2. Clone [this repository](https://github.com/ArturColen/VirtualAssistant) on your machine
* Create a folder on your computer for this program
* Open the `terminal` inside this folder
* Copy the [URL](https://github.com/ArturColen/VirtualAssistant.git) from the repository
* Type `git clone <URL copied>` and press `enter`

### 3. Still inside the terminal, install the following library:
* Speech Recognition: `pip install SpeechRecognition`

### 4. Run the program from the terminal
* `python virtual-assistant.py`
