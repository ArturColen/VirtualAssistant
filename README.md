# Creating a virtual assistant with Python
Project developed through a video lesson from [Digital Innovation One](https://www.dio.me/) with the goal of introducing knowledge about IoT and Machine Learning. For this, a virtual assistant was created using the Python programming language, along with the OS and Speech Recognition libraries.

# 🔨 Project functionality
The main function of this project is to make the virtual assistant perform some simple functions, such as typing what the user said, opening Google Chrome and Excel.

# 💻 Technologies and techniques used
